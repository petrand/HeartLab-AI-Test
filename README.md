# HeartLab-AI-Test 
Creating a model to classify pneumonia from x-ray images  <br />
You can find the report in the file named "HeartLab AI Test Report". <br />
 Running the src/main.py file will train the model and run the unit tests.  <br />
 
 The data preprocessing code is located in src/main.py <br />
 The model and evaluation code is located in src/model.py <br />
 All evaluation graphs and reports will be placed in evaluation_results folder <br />
 The model is saved to saved_model/cnn_model and can be loaded (see src/main.py for commented out code)  <br />
 The unit tests code is located in tests/preprocessing_tests.py for data preprocessing tests and tests/model_tests.py for rotation and noise test. <br />
 The test results will be printed in line when src/main.py is executed, for noise and rotation test classification report is located in evaluation_results/noisy_classification_report.txt <br />
